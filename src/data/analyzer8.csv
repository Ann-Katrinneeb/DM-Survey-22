BW 7.5 on Hana is a stable platform for EDW and meets most business requirements, though new features are difficult to adopt such as high manual effort required to convert from multi-providers to composite providers. Concern that SAP strategy to B4 Hana is too disruptive and restrictive, not providing an easy migration or compelling reason to move, yet I understand 7.5 is last release.  BW on Hana on 7.5 is a mix of IDE in Sap gui and Hana Studio and web ide that will unlikely be unified.   SAP front end client tools continue to be a concern with SAP roadmap abruptly dropping Lumira Discovery and declaring SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) is the only future.   This leaves questions of BW on premise and integration concerns with SAC as the BW Live features require 7.5 SP12 or even higher, unreleased versions.  Also have departments preferring non-SAP client tools like Tableau.

Der Fragebogen zielt auf die Kombination Software plus Organisation plus Themenbereich ab. Welche Software für welche Architektur erfolgreich verwendet werden kann, dass wäre für mich von Interesse. Datenbanken wie HANA, SQL Server usw. haben wir alles im Einsatz, würde ich aber niemals als DWH Produkt nennen. Ein Motor ist auch noch kein Auto. Ich brauch den Motor zwar, aber er bringt mich nicht von A nach B . Die Möglichkeit fachliche Anforderungen schnell und transparent umzusetzen ohne technische Schulden zu machen, ist von der Datenbank beinahe unabhängig und das gilt aus meiner Erfahrung auch für Performance. Gute Architektur bringt einen Performanceboost, den Sie mit einer DB nicht erreichen, außer Sie bauen die Lösung um die DB herum, dann stellt sich allerdings die Frage, ob das gute Architektur ist?
